Ecopoint Control System

Objectives:
Develop a simple object-oriented model.
Implement a set of classes that have instance methods, instance variables and constructors.
Implement classes with composition relationships between them.
Use concepts that facilitate software maintenance and reuse (encapsulation).
Use arrays to organize objects
The work must be developed individually.

The Problem:

An Ecopoint is a place where anyone can deposit recyclable waste of a certain type.

Each Ecopoint has a name, location (address), a person responsible for it and one or more different types of waste that it can receive.

The people responsible for the Ecopoints are represented with the attributes: name and CPF

The types of waste that an ecopoint can receive are: You can decide

Required features:

register Ecopoints
manage the types of waste that a given Ecopoint can receive (include and remove)
register people responsible for ecopoints
register types of waste that can be sent to ecopoints
present all registered Ecopoints (name, name of person responsible, types of waste received)
present all registered Ecopoints that receive a given type of waste
...
An important aspect to be observed is that each class developed in this work must have a well-defined "responsibility" and be limited to fulfilling this responsibility.

For example, interaction with the user is a responsibility of the user interface class (or classes) (therefore, only it will use System.out.println and Scanner)

Evaluation:

The evaluation will be carried out based on the following elements:

the analysis of the structure of the source program: the work must be well structured and employ the OO model;
the implemented functionalities
